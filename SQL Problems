# Where: (DB Tutorial 5 --> Create Views and Outer Joins)
### Example 1: 
You can create a view by saying:

CREATE VIEW firstview as
  select distinct empno from empcourse

This view can be accessed by

SELECT * from firstview

It continues to exist for all questions in this tutorial section. 
To get rid of it use "drop view firstview".

Create a view "secondview" which shows all employees who have an empno less than 5. 
In order to get a mark for this you must finish the queries with "select * from secondview". 

(Assumptions: )
(Actions: )
(Variables & Tables: )
(Process: )
(Clauses: )
________________________________________________________________________
### Example 2: create a view which lists the number of courses each empno has been on, and confirm this as
being correct by executing "select * from viewname" on it as the last select command of your SQL. 
(Assumptions: )
(Actions: )
(Variables & Tables: )
(Process: )
(Clauses: )
________________________________________________________________________
### Example 3: create a view which lists the number of jobs each empno has been on, and confirm this as
being correct by executing "select * from viewname" on it.
(Assumptions: )
(Actions: )
(Variables & Tables: )
(Process: )
(Clauses: )
________________________________________________________________________
### Example 4: create a statement which combines the views from questions 2 and 3 together to show how
many jobs and how many courses each empno has been on. You SHOULD NOT create the views again as part of the answer, 
just access them with the same name used to create them in the previous questions. If the employee has been on 0 courses then the total
no of courses for that employee should be blank (null). Hint: use OUTER JOIN.
(Assumptions: )
(Actions: )
(Variables & Tables: )
(Process: )
(Clauses: )
________________________________________________________________________
### Example 5: Create a view which is identical to department except it only contains departments whose HEAD is equal to the empno of
an employee with a surname "Jones". Run a "select * from viewname" to confirm this.

(Variables & Tables: )
(Process: )
(Clauses: )
________________________________________________________________________
### Example 6: Using the view created in question 5 (and NOT the DEPARTMENT table) list the surname and forenames of
all employees against the department name they work in. If an employee's department does not exist in the view then show 
the department name as a blank. Use an OUTER JOIN.
(Assumptions: )
(Actions: )
(Variables & Tables: )
(Process: )
(Clauses: )
________________________________________________________________________
### Example 7: Modify your query as produced in question 6 so that if the department name is not present ni the view then the
department name appears as "UNKNOWN" (in upper case). Use a UNION and not an OUTER JOIN to do this.
(Assumptions: )
(Actions: )
(Variables & Tables: )
(Process: )
(Clauses: )
________________________________________________________________________
### Example 8: Write a query which lists all empno values against the NAME of the courses they did. If an empno has not been on any courses
list the empno against a blank course. Hint: you have to handle two joins which involve NULL; empcourse and course.
